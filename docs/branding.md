Here are your detailed text-to-image prompts for all four assets, precisely describing the style of the W mark you've uploaded:

## App Icon — The "W" Mark

Looking at your uploaded icon, the W has a very distinctive character: it's a bold, geometric, condensed letterform with sharp angular cuts, slightly flared/tapered strokes that widen at the top, a deep central V notch, and an overall modern-aggressive silhouette that leans slightly editorial and fashion-forward. Here's how to prompt it:

### Icon Version 1 — White Letter, Transparent Background

```
A single bold geometric letter "W" app icon, pure white fill, 
fully transparent background, PNG format. The W is a custom 
condensed display letterform with thick angular strokes that 
taper and flare outward at the top, sharp diagonal cuts on 
the outer legs, a deep sharp central V-notch at the bottom 
center, and a small pointed inner peak rising from the notch. 
The overall shape is wide, flat, and aggressive — similar to 
a high-fashion or editorial logotype. Flat vector design, 
no shadows, no gradients, no outlines, no background fill, 
centered composition, icon proportions (1:1 square canvas). 
Isolated white vector glyph on alpha channel.
```

### Icon Version 2 — Black Letter, Transparent Background

```
A single bold geometric letter "W" app icon, pure black fill, 
fully transparent background, PNG format. The W is a custom 
condensed display letterform with thick angular strokes that 
taper and flare outward at the top, sharp diagonal cuts on 
the outer legs, a deep sharp central V-notch at the bottom 
center, and a small pointed inner peak rising from the notch. 
The overall shape is wide, flat, and aggressive — similar to 
a high-fashion or editorial logotype. Flat vector design, 
no shadows, no gradients, no outlines, no background fill, 
centered composition, icon proportions (1:1 square canvas). 
Isolated black vector glyph on alpha channel.

## Logo — "witt" Wordmark

The wordmark should feel like it belongs to the same family as the W icon — condensed, geometric, slightly editorial, lowercase or all-caps depending on brand direction. Since the app name is WITT, a lowercase "witt" feels modern and approachable while all-caps "WITT" feels authoritative. Provide both in your prompts and choose after seeing results.

### Logo Version 1 — White "witt", Transparent Background

```
A wordmark logo that reads "witt" in pure white, fully 
transparent background, PNG format. The typeface is a bold 
condensed geometric sans-serif with custom character shaping — 
thick uniform strokes, tight letter spacing, slightly 
aggressive angular terminals. The letter W specifically mirrors 
a bold geometric display W with flared outer legs, sharp 
angular diagonal cuts, and a deep central V-notch. The 
letters i, t, t are equally bold and condensed, with 
minimal dot on the i, flat crossbars on the t's, and 
consistent stroke weight throughout. Flat vector design, 
no shadows, no gradients, no decorative elements, no 
background fill. White typographic logo on fully transparent 
alpha channel. Clean, modern, editorial feel.

### Logo Version 2 — Black "witt", Transparent Background

```
A wordmark logo that reads "witt" in pure black, fully 
transparent background, PNG format. The typeface is a bold 
condensed geometric sans-serif with custom character shaping — 
thick uniform strokes, tight letter spacing, slightly 
aggressive angular terminals. The letter W specifically mirrors 
a bold geometric display W with flared outer legs, sharp 
angular diagonal cuts, and a deep central V-notch. The 
letters i, t, t are equally bold and condensed, with 
minimal dot on the i, flat crossbars on the t's, and 
consistent stroke weight throughout. Flat vector design, 
no shadows, no gradients, no decorative elements, no

## Tips for Best Results

**Tools to use these prompts in:** Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, DALL·E 3, or Ideogram (Ideogram is particularly strong for typography and logomarks).

**For Midjourney**, append `--v 6 --ar 1:1 --style raw` for the icon, and `--ar 3:1 --style raw` for the horizontal wordmark logo.

**For true transparency**, whatever tool you use will likely generate a white or solid background — you'll want to run the output through **Adobe Express**, **remove.bg**, or **Photoshop's Remove Background** tool to get the actual transparent PNG.

**Best advice overall:** Use these prompts to get close, then take the result into **Adobe Illustrator** or **Figma** and use it as a reference to manually recreate the vector mark cleanly. That gives you a true scalable SVG for all production uses.
