Here's a comprehensive breakdown of everything your app needs, followed by name ideas.

---

## Core Modules & Features

### 1. AI-Powered Test Prep Engine
This is the heart of the app. It should support adaptive learning — meaning the system tracks which topics a student struggles with and automatically serves more questions in those areas. It should cover multiple question types: multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and essay prompts. Support for major standardized tests is essential — SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, LSAT, MCAT, AP exams, and regional equivalents like WAEC, JAMB, BECE, and others depending on your target market.

### 2. Flashcard System (Quizlet-Style)
Students should be able to create, import, and share flashcard decks. Build in a spaced repetition algorithm (like SM-2) so cards are shown at optimal intervals for long-term memory retention. Cards should support text, images, audio pronunciation, and even short video clips. Deck sharing and community-uploaded decks are a big engagement driver.

### 3. AI Homework Helper
A conversational AI tutor that walks students through problems step by step rather than just giving answers. It should support math (with equation rendering via LaTeX), sciences, history, literature, coding, and more. A photo-scan feature where students snap a picture of a handwritten or printed question and the AI solves/explains it is a must-have in 2024+.

### 4. Practice Exams & Mock Tests
Full-length timed mock exams that simulate real test conditions. Instant scoring with detailed answer explanations. Post-test analytics showing performance by topic, time spent per question, accuracy rate, and improvement over time. Students should be able to retake tests and track their score trajectory.

### 5. Brain & Logic Challenges
Daily brain teasers, puzzles, and logic challenges to keep students cognitively sharp and the app sticky. Leaderboards, streaks, and badges make this module highly engaging. Include math puzzles, word problems, lateral thinking questions, memory games, and pattern recognition challenges.

### 6. Vocabulary Builder & Dictionary
A built-in dictionary with definitions, etymology, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences. A curated word-of-the-day feature. Subject-specific vocabulary lists (medical, legal, scientific, literary). Students should be able to save words into personal vocab lists and then automatically generate flashcards from those lists. Audio pronunciation in multiple accents (American, British, etc.) is important.

### 7. Note-Taking & Study Planner
An integrated note editor where students can organize notes by subject, topic, and date. The AI should be able to summarize uploaded notes and generate practice questions directly from them. Pair this with a study planner that lets students set exam dates, and the app automatically builds a study schedule backward from that deadline.

### 8. AI Quiz & Question Generator
Students paste in a textbook paragraph, upload a PDF, or type a topic and the app generates a quiz instantly. Teachers can use this to create assignments. This is one of the most powerful features for both students and educators.

### 9. Progress Dashboard & Analytics
A clean visual dashboard showing streaks, topics mastered, weak areas, hours studied, and predicted readiness scores for upcoming exams. Gamification elements like XP points, level-ups, and achievement badges keep motivation high.

### 10. Community & Social Layer
Study groups where students can collaborate, share decks, and quiz each other. A Q&A forum where students post questions and get answers from peers or AI. Leaderboards within friend groups and schools add healthy competition.

### 11. Teacher & Parent Portal
Teachers can assign homework, create custom quizzes, and monitor class performance. Parents can view their child's activity, time spent studying, and progress reports. This institutional angle is key for school partnerships and B2B revenue.

### 12. Offline Mode
Students in areas with unreliable internet (especially relevant for markets like Ghana, Nigeria, and across Africa) need to be able to download content and study offline.

Great additions! Let me flesh these out in full detail.


### 13. Lecture Capture & AI Summarization

This is one of the most powerful features you can offer university and high school students. The module works in two modes — **live recording** and **upload & process**.

In live recording mode, the student opens the app at the start of a lecture and hits record. The app captures audio (and optionally video) while the student can also jot quick manual notes alongside the recording. The AI runs real-time or post-session transcription using speech-to-text, then automatically generates a structured summary with headings, key points, definitions spotted in the lecture, and action items or assignments the lecturer mentioned. It should also timestamp important moments so the student can tap a section of the summary and jump directly to that moment in the recording.

In upload mode, students can import pre-recorded lecture videos (MP4, MOV), audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A), or even recorded Zoom/Google Meet sessions. The AI processes these the same way — transcription first, then structured summary generation.

The notes view should be clean and readable, organized by subject and date, with the original recording always accessible alongside the summary. Students should be able to edit and annotate the AI-generated summary, highlight sections, and add their own comments on top.

**Export options are critical here.** Every summary and note should be exportable as:
- **DOCX** — formatted Word document with headings, bullet points, and a clean layout for printing or editing
- **PDF** — polished, branded, print-ready version
- **ePub** — for reading on e-readers like Kindle or Apple Books, ideal for long lecture series or compiled course notes

The viewing experience should be fully responsive across phone, tablet, and web, with a reader mode that optimizes for comfortable long-form reading on any screen size.

Speaker identification is a bonus feature — if a lecture has multiple speakers (e.g., a panel or seminar), the AI labels who said what. Multi-language transcription support is also important for non-English institutions.


### 14. Educational Games

Games are your most powerful engagement and retention tool. The key is to make every game genuinely educational rather than just decorative. Here's a suite of games to build:

**Word Duel** — two players go head to head answering vocabulary or spelling questions in real time. First to answer correctly wins the round. Great for vocabulary building.

**Quiz Royale** — a multiplayer battle royale format where up to 50 students join a room and answer questions simultaneously. Wrong answers eliminate players. Last one standing wins. Perfect for classroom use.

**Equation Rush** — a fast-paced math game where equations fly across the screen and students solve them before they reach the edge. Difficulty scales with performance.

**Fact or Fiction** — a true/false rapid-fire game with a timer countdown. Uses curriculum-aligned content so it's always relevant to what the student is studying.

**Crossword Builder** — auto-generated crosswords from the student's own flashcard decks or vocabulary lists. Deeply reinforces recall.

**Memory Match** — classic card-flip matching game using terms and definitions from the student's study material.

**Timeline Challenge** — students arrange historical events in correct chronological order. Great for history, science timelines, and literary periods.

**Spelling Bee Mode** — audio plays a word, student types the spelling. Progressive difficulty levels. Leaderboards by age group and region.

**Subject Boss Battles** — at the end of a study module, the student faces a "boss" — a set of 20 hard questions from that topic. Defeating the boss unlocks a badge and new content.

All games should feed into the overall XP and achievement system, and teachers should be able to assign specific games to the class as homework activities.


### 15. Study & Exam Planner

This module acts as the student's personal academic strategist. When a student adds an upcoming exam or assignment deadline, the planner works backward from that date and builds a day-by-day study schedule, automatically allocating time to each topic based on the student's known weak areas from their performance data.

Key features within the planner include a **smart schedule builder** that asks the student how many hours per day they can study, which days they're unavailable, and which subjects need the most attention — then generates a realistic, balanced plan. The plan is always adjustable, and if a student misses a session, the planner automatically redistributes that content across remaining days without losing the thread.

A **subject and topic breakdown view** shows everything the student needs to cover for an exam, checkable as they complete each area. This works best when tied to a syllabus upload — the student uploads their official syllabus or topic list and the app maps it into the planner automatically.

**Daily study goals** with push notification reminders keep students on track. Each morning the app tells the student exactly what to study that day. Completing daily goals feeds the streak and XP system.

The planner should also support **assignment tracking** — not just exams but essays, lab reports, group projects, and any other academic deliverables with deadlines.

A **calendar view** (daily, weekly, monthly) alongside a **list view** gives students flexibility in how they see their workload. Color coding by subject makes the calendar easy to scan at a glance.

### 16. Exam Tracker

Where the Study Planner looks forward, the Exam Tracker looks at the full picture — a dedicated space where students log and manage every exam they've taken or are preparing for, across their entire academic journey.

Each exam entry captures the exam name, subject, date, type (standardized test, school exam, mock test, internal assessment), and the student's result once available. Over time this builds a **complete academic history** the student can refer back to, share with parents, or use in applications.

The tracker's most powerful feature is its **performance trend analysis**. For any subject or exam type, the student can see their score history plotted as a chart — are they improving, plateauing, or declining? The AI reads these trends and makes recommendations: "Your Math scores have plateaued over your last 3 practice tests. We recommend focusing on Algebra and Trigonometry this week."

**Upcoming exam countdowns** are displayed prominently — a dashboard widget shows days remaining to each registered exam with a readiness percentage based on the student's current practice performance.

**Target score tracking** is another key feature. A student sets a target score (say, 1400 on the SAT) and the tracker maps their current mock test scores against that target, showing the gap and projecting whether they're on track to hit it based on their improvement rate.

For standardized tests, the tracker should include **registration deadline reminders** — the app knows when major test registration windows open and close, and notifies students well in advance so they don't miss sign-up deadlines.

A **subject-level breakdown within each exam** shows not just the overall score but performance per section, so a student can see they scored 780 in Reading but 590 in Math and immediately know where to focus.

Finally, an **export and share** function lets students generate a clean PDF report of their exam history and progress — useful for parent-teacher meetings, scholarship applications, or personal records.

## Technical Must-Haves
The app needs multi-language support, dark mode, cross-platform availability (iOS, Android, and a web version), push notifications for study reminders, and end-to-end data privacy compliance. A freemium model with a generous free tier and a premium subscription unlocking AI features, unlimited tests, and advanced analytics is the proven monetization path.
