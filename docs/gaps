## Current gaps (real state now)

### P0
- **None currently blocking** (analyze clean, tests passing in smoke suite).

### P1
1. **Multiplayer still UI-only** (no Supabase Realtime session/channel wiring yet).  
2. **Server-authoritative limits not yet enforced in app flow** (`record_game_played()` / daily post limit tables exist but app logic still local-first).

### P2
3. **Report UX still partial** (feed has reporting path; forum/deck flows still incomplete in UI).  
4. **Supabase advisors check still pending** (security/performance scan after additive migration).  
5. **Push notifications wiring still pending** (OneSignal initialized, event triggers missing).  
6. **Language setting tile still stubbed** (`onTap` placeholder).  
7. **Theme/appearance setting still stubbed** (no ThemeMode provider integration).

## What’s solid now ✅

- `flutter analyze --no-pub`: clean
- Phase 4 routing + role guard
- Hive persistence for social/games/translation
- Analytics utility + key action wiring
- Content moderation flag on social post model
- Supabase additive migration applied
- Translation stack switched to OSS LibreTranslate
- Currency localization integrated into paywall surfaces

If you want, next I’ll do the **P1 server-authoritative limits** wiring first (game/post limits via Supabase) since that’s the highest remaining risk.
